## 1. Purpose
To provide safe and effective use instructions for the DeWalt DCW210N 20V Max 5-inch brushless cordless random orbital sander for sanding wood, metal, plastics, and painted surfaces.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to operators using the DeWalt DCW210N orbital sander in various professional and DIY applications.

## 3. Safety Precautions
- Always wear safety glasses, hearing protection, and a dust mask.
- Avoid loose clothing, jewelry, and secure long hair to prevent entanglement.
- Do not use the sander in damp or wet environments or near flammable liquids.
- Disconnect the battery pack before making any adjustments or changing accessories.
- Use only DeWalt recommended batteries and chargers.
- Use dust extraction to maintain a clean working environment and protect respiratory health.

## 4. Pre-Operation Checks
- Inspect the sander, sanding pad, and battery for any damage.
- Confirm the battery is charged.
- Use hook and loop sanding discs (127 mm) with the 8-hole dust pattern recommended for this model.
- Check that the sanding pad and disc are clean and properly aligned.
- Ensure the dust collection bag or vacuum connection is securely attached if used.

## 5. Assembly and Setup
- Attach the sanding disc by aligning the holes and pressing onto the hook and loop pad.
- Mount the battery pack into the tool handle until it clicks securely.
- Connect the dust bag or the vacuum hose to the dust extraction port if available.

## 6. Operation
- Turn the sander on by pressing the "I" side of the dust-sealed on/off switch.
- Adjust the variable speed dial to set the speed between 8,000 and 12,000 orbits per minute (OPM) based on the material and application:
  - Higher speeds for harder materials and rapid material removal.
  - Lower speeds for softer materials and finer finishes.
- Hold the sander firmly with both hands, keep the pad flat on the work surface.
- Move the sander in smooth, overlapping motions without applying excessive pressure.
- Keep the sanding pad moving constantly to avoid gouging the surface.
- Use the dust extraction during operation to reduce airborne dust and improve visibility.

## 7. Post-Operation
- Turn off the sander using the "O" side of the switch.
- Wait until the sander comes to a complete stop before setting it down.
- Remove the battery pack by pressing the release button and sliding it out.
- Empty and clean the dust bag; if connected to a vacuum, check the vacuum system.
- Clean the sanding pad and tool body from dust and debris.
- Inspect the sanding disc for wear and replace as needed.

## 8. Maintenance
- Regularly inspect and clean vents to prevent overheating.
- Replace worn sanding pads and discs with DeWalt-approved parts.
- Keep switch and motor dust-sealed to prolong tool life.
- Store the tool and batteries in the designated container and cabinet.
- Have repairs performed by authorized service centers.
