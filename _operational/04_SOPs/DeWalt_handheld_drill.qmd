## 1. Purpose
To ensure safe and effective use of a battery-powered DeWalt drill for drilling and screwdriving tasks.

## 2. Scope
This procedure covers the operation, maintenance, and safety guidelines for the DeWalt cordless drill.

## 3. Safety Precautions
- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE): safety glasses and hearing protection, if necessary.
- Ensure the work area is clean, well-lit, and free of hazards.
- Inspect the drill and battery for obvious damage before use.
- Keep the drill away from rain or wet conditions to avoid electric shock.
- Never attempt to change drill bits or accessories with the drill powered on.
- Use only genuine DeWalt batteries and chargers.
- Bring the drill to the supervisor/GSR if it is faulty or damaged.

## 4. Pre-Operation Checks
- Verify that the battery pack is charged.
- Confirm the drill is switched off before inserting the battery.
- Inspect drill bits or screwdriving accessories for wear or damage.
- Ensure the drill’s chuck is open enough to accept the drill bit.

## 5. Assembly
- Align the battery pack with the drill handle slots and slide it in until it clicks securely.
- Check the battery pack is firmly locked in place.
- Select the appropriate drill bit or accessory.
- Open the chuck by turning it counterclockwise and insert the drill bit fully.
- Tighten the chuck by turning it clockwise firmly by hand.

## 6. Operation
- Turn the mode selector to the desired setting (drilling, screwdriving with appropriate clutch setting).
- Select the speed according to the task (use lower speed for high torque tasks, higher speed for wood drilling).
- Hold the drill firmly.
- Apply steady pressure in a straight line with the drill bit or screw.
- Squeeze the trigger to start the drill; release the trigger to stop.
- Use the forward/reverse switch for tightening or loosening screws.
- Avoid continuous use at variable speeds to prevent switch damage.
- When drilling, keep the motor running while pulling the bit out to avoid jamming.

## 7. Post-Operation
- Turn off the drill and release the trigger.
- Remove the battery pack by pressing the release buttons and pulling it out.
- Clean dirt and dust from vents and exterior with a dry cloth or compressed air.
- Store the drill and batteries in a cool, dry place.
- Recharge the battery if needed using only the designated DeWalt charger.

## 8. Maintenance

- Never perform mainenance on the drill by yourself, report every suspicious machine functionality to GSR.
- Have repairs performed by certified service centers.
- Never use solvents on plastic parts; clean with mild detergent and damp cloth.
