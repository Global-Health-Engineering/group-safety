## 1. Purpose  
To establish safe and consistent operating procedures for using the drill press equipped with a simple speed selector switch, minimizing risks and ensuring quality drilling.

## 2. Scope  
Applies to all authorized and trained personnel operating the drill press in the GHE workshop.

## 3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)  
- Safety glasses or face shield  
- Hearing protection if needed  
- **No loose clothing, jewelry, or gloves**  
- Long hair tied back  
- Closed-toe shoes  

## 4. Pre-Operation Checks  
- Ensure the work area is clean, dry, and free of obstructions.  
- Check that the drill press is securely mounted or stable.  
- Verify that all guards and safety shields are in place.  
- Inspect the electrical cord and plug for damage.  
- Confirm the drill bit is sharp, correctly sized, and securely tightened with the chuck key removed before operation.  
- Adjust the table height and angle as required and securely lock in position.  
- Clamp the workpiece securely with a vise or clamps to prevent movement.  
- Set the depth stop if applicable.  

## 5. Speed Selection  
- Select **Slow** speed for harder materials or larger diameter bits to prevent overheating and bit damage.  
- Select **Fast** speed for softer materials or smaller diameter bits for cleaner, faster drilling.  

## 6. Operating Procedures  
- Stand clear of the rotating drill bit and ensure no body parts or loose items are near moving parts.  
- Turn the drill press ON using the main switch.  
- Slowly lower the drill bit to the workpiece, applying moderate, steady pressure—do not force the drill bit.  
- Use the appropriate coolant or lubricant for metal drilling if necessary.  
- Drill fully through the workpiece or to the desired depth, then slowly retract the drill bit.  
- Turn the drill press OFF before removing the workpiece or making adjustments.  

## 7. Post-Operation  
- Wait for the drill bit to stop moving completely before opening any guards or removing the workpiece.  
- Use a brush to clean metal or wood chips from the table—never use hands.  
- Remove and store drill bits properly and clean the chuck if needed.  
- Ensure the machine is turned OFF and unplugged if cleaning or maintenance is required.  
- Keep the area around the drill press clean and free of debris.  
- Clean the area after use, disposing of any waste materials properly.  

## 8. Emergency Procedures  
- Know the location of the emergency stop and the main power switch.  
- In case of abnormal noise, vibration, or malfunction, stop the machine immediately.  
- Report any injuries or malfunctions to the supervisor immediately.
