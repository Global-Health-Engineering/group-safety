[← Back to Appendix 4: Collection of Operating Instructions, User Manuals, and SOPs"](../04_operating_instructions_user_manuals_SOPs.qmd)

## 1. Purpose
Ensure the **safe, efficient, and correct use** of the Trotec Q400 laser cutter for material engraving or cutting, while protecting users, bystanders, and equipment.

## 2. Scope
Applies to **all personnel** trained and authorized to operate, maintain, or supervise the Trotec Q400 laser cutter in a laboratory, classroom, or workshop environment.[6]

## 3. Responsibilities
- **Operator:** Perform all checks, operate safely, and report issues.
- **Supervisor/GSR:** Maintain machine, review procedures, and provide training.

## 4. Equipment Checklist
- Trotec Q400 laser cutter
- Required workpiece material (CO₂ laser compatible)
- Appropriate exhaust/filtration systems running
- PPE: safety glasses (laser-rated), no reflective clothing/jewelry
- Computer with Trotec Ruby software

## 5. Safety Precautions
- Only **trained users** may operate the laser.
- Never operate the Q400 with housing/interlocks bypassed or defective.
- Always use the **extraction system** to remove fumes and particulates.
- Never leave the laser running unattended.
- Remove all flammable objects from the enclosure before starting.
- Maintain a clean area around the machine; avoid clutter.
- In case of fire or malfunction, **immediately use emergency stop and follow building procedures**.
- Do not engrave/cut materials not verified as safe for CO₂ lasers, e.g., **never cut/engrave PVC**.

## 6. Pre-Operation

1. **Visual Inspection:**
   - Ensure lens, mirrors, and glass are clean.
   - Confirm laser bed is clear of debris from previous operations.
   - Inspect enclosure and interlocks.

2. **Material Preparation:**
   - Place approved material flat on bed. Secure if needed (avoid warping or movement).

3. **Power Up:**
   - Switch on the main machine power and the PC with Trotec Ruby software.

4. **Focus and Home:**
   - Focus laser using the provided focusing tool or SonarTechnology™ auto-focus.[5][6]
   - Home the machine (move to origin).

5. **File Setup:**
   - Open or import project file in Trotec Ruby. Ensure correct vector/raster mode is selected and all elements are set to correct “hairline” or color coding for cutting vs. engraving.

6. **Parameter Check:**
   - Set speed, power, and frequency to recommended values for the material and process. Reference Trotec’s database or your prior experience.
   - Setting correct parameters may require testing on scrap material first.

## 7. Operation

1. **Preview:**
   - Use Trotec Ruby's outline/preview mode to check laser path.
   - Verify job boundaries fit within the workpiece.

2. **Run Job:**
   - Close the lid fully and check all safety interlocks.
   - Start the job. **Monitor process at all times**—never leave unattended.
   - The exhaust system should start automatically; ensure it is functioning, if not, stop the job immediately.

3. **Intervene if Needed:**
   - Press the emergency stop or open the lid to stop the laser immediately in case of problem.[6]

## 8. Emergency Procedures

- **Fire:** Use emergency stop; if safe, extinguish fire with CO₂/dry chemical extinguisher or fire blanket.
- **Fume Exposure:** Stop machine, evacuate area, seek medical evaluation if exposed.
- **Electric/Laser Hazard:** Disconnect from power; do not attempt repairs unless authorized.

## 9. Post-Operation

1. **Job Completion:**
   - Wait for all motion to stop before opening the lid.
   - Wait another 30 seconds for the fumes to be fully extracted before opening the lid.
   - Remove finished item and inspect for completeness.

2. **Clean-Up:**
   - Remove any debris/scrap from bed and surrounding area.

3. **Shutdown:**
   - Power down the machine (the exhaust system should have powered down automatically).
   - Do not power down, nor close the screen of the PC; log out/lock the computer instead.

## 10. Maintenance (Operator Tasks)
- Clean optics as scheduled or when needed.
- Inspect/care for air assist, fans, and filters.
- Report any faults or errors to the supervisor/GSR.
