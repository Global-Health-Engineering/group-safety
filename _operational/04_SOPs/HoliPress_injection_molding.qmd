## 1. Purpose
To safely and efficiently operate the HoliPress 38 for manual plastic injection molding to produce high-quality plastic parts, prototypes, or small batch productions.

## 2. Scope
Applicable to all operators using the HoliPress 38 for prototyping, material testing, recycling, and small-scale production in workshops, labs, or educational settings.

## 3. Safety Precautions
- Always wear provided personal protective equipment (PPE): safety glasses and thermal gloves.
- Ensure the machine is placed on a stable, flat surface.
- Keep hands and loose clothing away from moving parts during operation.
- Allow the machine to cool down before maintenance or cleaning.

## 4. Machine Description
- Injection volume capacity: 38 ${\rm cm^3}$.
- Triple heating zones for precise temperature control up to 320 °C.
- Length-adjustable injection lever for ergonomic operation.
- Adjustable mold height up to 190 mm.
- PID temperature control for consistent melting.
- Manual clamping vice compatible with various mold types (metal, SLA, FDM).
- Injection speed adjustable between 2 to 10 seconds.
- Power consumption: 860 W at 220 V.

## 5. Preparation
- Inspect the machine and all accessories for damage or wear.
- Select and install the appropriate mold in the clamping vice; secure firmly.
- Adjust the mold height as needed for your specific mold.
- Install the shut-off nozzle (5 mm heated nozzle included).
- Preheat the machine using the triple heating zones:
  - Set each temperature zone according to the plastic material specifications (consult material datasheets).
  - Allow the machine to reach stable set temperatures before injection.

## 6. Material Loading
- Use industrial-grade plastic granules suitable for injection at ≤320°C.
- Load the plastic granules into the heating chamber.
- Rotate the lever system to feed and melt the plastic.
- Ensure the plastic is properly melted and plasticized before injecting.

## 7. Injection Process
- Adjust the injection lever length for comfortable operation.
- Begin the injection by pressing the lever steadily to inject melted plastic into the mold cavity.
- Maintain closing pressure using the manual clamping vice during injection.
- Allow the plastic to cool and solidify in the mold.
- Release the mold clamp and remove the molded part carefully.

## 8. Post-Injection
- Purge the machine using the included purge block to clean out residual plastic.
- Clean the nozzle and heating chamber with supplied cleaning tools.
- Store unused granules properly to avoid contamination.
- Inspect the injected parts for quality and defects.
- **Never swich off the machine with the piston in the injection position**; always place the piston back in locked position before powering down.

## 9. Maintenance
- Regularly clean the nozzle and purge block after use to prevent clogging.
- Check the heating elements and temperature sensors periodically.
- Lubricate moving parts as recommended by the manufacturer.
- Report any malfunction or unusual operation immediately.

## 10. Troubleshooting
- Inconsistent injection pressure or plastic flow may indicate blockage—clean nozzle and purge system.
- Temperature instability—check PID controller settings and heating zones.
- Mold leakage—ensure mold is properly clamped and seals are intact.

## 11. Additional Notes
- HoliPress 38 supports a wide range of plastics including recycled granules and technical materials.
- Use the machine as a flexible tool for prototypes, education, material characterization, and small batch production.
- Consult specific plastic material datasheets for melting temperatures and injection parameters.
