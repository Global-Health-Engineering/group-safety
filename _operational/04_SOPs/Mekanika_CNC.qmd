## 1. Purpose
To ensure **safe** and **efficient operation** of the Mekanika Pro CNC milling machine within educational or public spaces, preventing accidents and ensuring high-quality results.

## 2. Scope
Applies to **all operators**, supervisors, and maintenance personnel responsible for using or servicing the CNC mill at premises of GHE, ETH Zurich.

## 3. Responsibilities
- **Operators:** Follow all procedures and safety guidelines.
- **Supervisors:** Ensure all staff are trained and SOPs are followed.
- **Maintenance:** Carry out routine checks and preventive maintenance.

## 4. Required Equipment
- Mekanika Pro CNC mill + PC & VFD spindle
- Tooling: end mills, collets, wrenches
- Spoilerboard, safety enclosure, dust shoe and dust collection system
- PPE: safety glasses, hearing protection, dust mask
- Clamping/tools for workpiece
- Measurement instruments: calipers, gauges
- Appropriate lubricants/coolants if needed

## 5. Safety Precautions
- Always wear **appropriate PPE**: safety glasses, gloves, and hearing protection.
- Ensure the **safety enclosure** is fully closed before starting any operation. The enclosure doors are interlocked to trigger an emergency stop if opened.
- Never bypass safety interlocks.
- Check that emergency stops and all controls are working before use.
- Keep the area **clean**, dry, and well-lit.
- Only **trained personnel** are permitted to operate the CNC mill.

## 6. Pre-Operation Procedure

1. **Inspect Machine:**
   - Check for any visible damage, loose or missing parts.
   - Ensure the worktable and spoilerboard are clear of debris.
   - Confirm all guards/enclosures are in place and secure.

2. **Prepare Tooling:**
   - Select appropriate end mill and collet size.
   - Inspect the tool for wear or damage.
   - Install end mill into spindle using both provided wrenches.

3. **Prepare Workpiece:**
   - Attach securely to the spoilerboard/worktable using appropriate clamps. Double-check tightness.

4. **Set Up Dust Collection:**
   - Attach dust shoe and connect the dust extraction system.
   - Ensure vacuum is functional before starting spindle.

5. **Power Up:**
   - Turn on the CNC machine and control PC. Confirm all system lights/status indicators are normal.

## 7. Operation

1. **Load/Check Program:**
   - Load G-Code file via touchscreen, USB, or network connection.
   - Double-check that the program matches the intended job (material, tool diameter, etc.).

2. **Pre-Run Checks:**
   - Use 'dry run' (without spindle engaged or at reduced speed) to verify there are no collisions in the toolpath.
   - Visually confirm the machine moves as expected.

3. **Start Job:**
   - Ensure all operators/observers are clear.
   - Start dust collection system.
   - Start spindle and machining program via control interface.
   - Monitor operation; remain alert for unusual noises, vibrations, or errors.

## 8. Emergency Procedures
- Use the EMERGENCY STOP button or open the enclosure door to stop the machine immediately if a **hazard** arises.
- Report any incident to the supervisor and do not resume operation until the cause is identified and fixed.

## 9. Post-Operation

1. **Job Completion:**
   - Wait for all movement to stop, then remove finished part.
   - Inspect both part and tooling for issues.

2. **Clean-Up:**
   - Use vacuum to clear debris from machine and work area.
   - Remove and store tools, collets, and clamps properly.

3. **Shutdown:**
   - Turn off spindle, dust collector, and CNC system.
   - Power down the control PC.
   - Ensure enclosure is closed and workspace is tidy and safe.

## 10. Maintenance
- Perform regular checks on spindle, tool holders, and safety features.
- Inspect dust filters and empty collection bins as required.
- Log maintenance in provided records or checklists.
