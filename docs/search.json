The bag is kept closed or placed in the biosafety cabinet. 3. Once the bag is full place it in the autoclave; make sure it is NOT tightly closed. 4. Run the standard autoclaving cycle (121 degree C, 15 min). 5. After cooldown, put the bag in a normal black bag and then in a normal waste bin.\nNotes: 1. Do not overload the bag above the max load level. 2. Use only approved autocavable bags for waste decontamination in autoclave. 3. Once the waste in a bag has been autoclaved, put it in a normal black waste bag. This psychological action will make cleaning services handle the autoclaved biological waste as normal waste."

    "section": "Standard Operating Procedures",
    "text": "Standard Operating Procedures\n\nBiogas measurements\nBiogas is a humid mixture of methane and carbon dioxide; with additional components being hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. In the laboratory experiments, it is being mimicked with pure methane and pure carbon dioxide.\nThe flow of both gases is regulated with Bronkhorst Flexiflow mass flow controllers.\nHumidity is regulated with two manual valves, splitting the flow so part of it passes through water bath.\nMethane is hazardous because it is extremely flammable and it acts as a simple asphyxiant. Rapidly expanding gas may cause frostbites (Joule-Thomson effect). More information about methane are found here.\nCarbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and can accumulate in lower parts of closed spaces risking suffocation in inhalation is prolonged. The laboratory is equipped with a CO_2 safety sensor and a shut-off valve on the CO_2 bottle. If CO_2 concentration rises above 1%, a warning is triggered and the CLA services are informed the gas supply is shut; if it raises above 2%, alarm is triggered and the CLA services are informed. More information about carbon dioxide can be found here.\nThe experimental procedure for work with methane and carbon dioxide is as follows: 1. Know placement of the fire extinguisher and the fire blanket (outside the lab, to the right). 2. Familiarize yourself with the CO2 display placement. Once the CO2 alarm is triggered, leave the lab immediately and wait outside the lab in the corridor for arrival of the building safety team. You can mute the alarm with a red button just outside the lab door (the alarm is mutted, cannot switched off). 3. Experiments with methane and carbon dioxide can be performed only inside the fume hood with the sliding door open to normal operating mode. Only in this mode, the circulation of air inside the fume hood is sufficient and the conditions are safe for operation, preventing the gases to flow outside the fume hood. 4. Before starting the measurements, always turn on the methane sensor installed in the fume hood. Once the alarm goes off, shut down the methane supply and inform Jakub Tkaczuk. 4. The senors should be connected to the outlet line, minimizing the risk of CH_4 or CO_2 excaping the fume hood. 5. Dr. Jakub Tkaczuk is responsible for connecting CH_4 and CO_2 bottles to the system. Do not connect them yourself. The gas cabinet with CH_4 and CO_2 bottles needs to be closed properly (handle pointing downwards). 6. Connect your test setup to gas supply and to the outlet. 7. Open the gas on/off valves first. 8. Use the regulator valves on the safety cabinet to control the gas flow. 9. Prevent unwanted pressure increase in closed containers; check for pressure valuve with pressure indicator on the fume hood. 10. After use, close the supply valve on the safety cabinet and the regulating valve. Hand tight is good enough, prevent over-tightening the knobs. 11. Before leaving the lab, double check whether both valves on the fume hood are closed. There is no need for closing the valve on the gas bottle. 12. It is forbidden to eat, smoke, and use open fire in the lab. 13. It is forbidden to open windows and work with open door. 14. Glasses are mandatory for everyone in the room, when experiments with gasses are under way. 8. Do not wear synthetic clothing; they melt and stick to exposed skin when on fire. 9. Do not wear headphones, do not listen to music to be able to hear gas leaks. 11. In case of emergency: inform the ETH mobile emergency contact from your mobile phone (+41 44 342 11 88) or from the phone next to the safety station on the corridor (888). 12. Work with methane and carbon dioxide is permitted with one additional person in the lab."

This safety concept incorporates the measures adopted by Global Health Engineering for occupational safety and for the safety of people, animals, and the environment.\nThe safety concept is based on the Safety concept according to ESV and SAMV for Level 2 laboratories and the corresponding guidelines of the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN): Operational safety concepts according to Containment Ordinance (ContainO). Various templates for operating instructions and rules of conduct have been adapted to the particular lab and are listed in the Annexes together with the already existing company documents containing performance standards for environmental and occupational safety and quality assurance.\nThis safety concept, as well as the general Biosafety Concept of ETH Zurich, is updated whenever the risk changes, especially when:\n\nnew working methods are adopted;\nnew organisms are handled;\nnew equipment relevant to biological safety is introduced;\nexisting premises are converted for other purposes, or new rooms are used;\nthe activities, processes, or the use of rooms have been discontinued (see Chapter 5.1)."

They ensure that the safety concept is implemented and followed and have established the organizational structure necessary for this purpose. At least one person has been entrusted with monitoring biological safety, the precise details concerning status, duties, and responsibilities have been set out in the job description. These job descriptions also specify the duties, tasks, and competencies of the laboratory managers and project leaders in everyday situations and emergencies. The job descriptions are an integral part of this specific biosafety concept. The necessary financial and personal resources to maintain biological and chemical safety are made available by GHE.\nAs a matter of principle, ETH Zurich as an institution (not an individual ETH employee) shall be held liable to third parties, both companies and persons. However, ETH may take recourse against employees who fail to comply with safety provisions deliberately or through gross negligence, thereby inflicting harm on a third party for which the ETH is liable. This covers the liability issue. The criminal law aspect must also be considered. Therefore, the following applies to all persons bearing responsibility for safety at ETH: The responsibility of persons under criminal law is derived from their sphere of responsibility concerning observing safety rules. Only those persons who, by their position, can prevent hazards through their intervention can be held accountable under criminal law. This is the case if they failed to intervene where intervention would have been appropriate and possible."

Suppose a sample containing organisms is transported outside the laboratory for diagnostic or research purposes. In that case, the smallest quantities and lowest concentration of cells possible9 are packed and transported with appropriate labelling. If waste involves a contamination risk, e.g., secretions or excreta, or strong-smelling or nauseating waste is transported, the labelling and packing regulations listed in Appendix 14 are applied.\nIn summary, the following applies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN number\nofficial description\nhazard label\nADR packaging instructions\nfield of application\n\n\n\n\nUN 3373\nbiological substances of category B\nClass 6.2\nP650\nGroup 2 (possibly 3) and category B of microorganisms\n\n\nUN 3245\ngenetically modified microorganisms\nClass 9\nP904\nGroup 1 microorganisms\n\n\nUN 1845\nDry ice (solid \\({\\rm CO_2}\\)), only to be marked for air transport\nClass 9\n\nPackaging material\n\n\nUN 1977\nLiquid nitrogen\nClass 2.2\n\nPackaging material"

The scopes of these ordinances complement each other and contribute to protection of the environment, population, and the health of individual employees.↩︎\nThe University defines its protection goals to prevent accidents at work as well as harmful and undesirable effects on the environment and the population.↩︎\nAccording to Article 7 Paragraph 4 of Ordinance 3 dated 18 August 1993 to the Employment Act (Health Protection, ArGV 3, SR 822.113), the following applies: “The rules regarding responsibilities in the plant/laboratory do not exempt the employer from his responsibility to protect health”.↩︎\nGuideline: Biosafety Officer (BSO) – Status, duties and responsibilities.↩︎\nThe attending doctor does not necessarily have to be an occupational health specialist but may, according to SAMV, also be a company doctor or an independent medical examiner. What is crucial, however, is that this person knows the work situation and the working conditions so that a link to the workplace can be established during the health assessment and the necessary plan of occupational health measures can be drawn up. In this regard, compare Art 2.4 of EKAS guideline 6508 on the calling-in of occupational health doctors and other occupational safety specialists.↩︎\nSee the implementation guide issued by SAEFL: M.

Proposals for structural/technical modifications (to the infrastructure or changes in the locking system) are sent via the GMIS-System. GHE itself commissions modifications to devices, machines, experiments, and others.\nSafety Officers are always consulted whenever new building work or structural modifications are carried out at ETH Zurich and when technical changes are made to safety-relevant facilities9.\nIn the event of modifications, repurposing, dismantling, and relocating activities, specially adapted safety precautions must be taken at the required time, especially regarding the decontamination of labs and technical equipment. If, despite prior decontamination, a chemical hazard or similar risk cannot be completely ruled out, this aspect is explicitly regulated for the phase of construction work with the increased risk, e.g., dismantling filters."

    "text": "General rules\n\nWhen handling disinfectants, always wear suitable gloves. Take into account potential allergies triggered by the gloves.\nUse only cold water to prepare the disinfectant solution to avoid vapors that can irritate the respiratory system. If necessary, prepare under the laboratory fume hood.\nUse the recommended dilution and concentration.\nLet the disinfectant soak and work for the prescribed time.\nConsider the useful life of disinfectants, according to the data provided by the manufacturer.

Around 70% of the air flow is recirculated in the compartment of the biosafety cabinet. The remaining 30% is discharged into the surrounding through the high-performance HEPA filters. This 30% flow is continuously extracted from the laboratory, contributing to occupational safety and the protection of health.\nGood microbiological practices (GMP) are essential outside and inside the safety cabinet, since they protect only against aerosol contamination and not against contact contamination. Therefore, the employee’s hands must remain inside the cabinet during work and must not be brought up to the face."

    "text": "Precautions and rules of conduct\n\nAvoid air currents in the working area. Keep windows and doors closed during work in the safety cabinet, open and close the door to the laboratory slowly.\nSwitch on the equipment approximately 10 to 30 minutes before starting your work. Only work in the cabinet with the GMP mode, do not use the Eco mode.\nAll zones need to be green in normal operation, if they are not, filtering does not work properly.\nUse personal protective equipment, a laboratory coat, gloves, and glasses.\nPrevent aerosol formation as far as possible, even under the safety cabinet.\nDo not disturb the laminar air flow in the cabinet:\n\nno rapid or violent movements;\nbring bulky equipment into the safety cabinet only if absolutely essential. Do it in the cleaning mode before starting your work, take it out in the cleaning mode after finishing your work.\ndo not store any unnecessary items in the safety cabinet;\ndo not use Bunsen burners over extended periods, only ignite as required, using a sensor or foot switch;\ndo not cover air holes.\n\nAll equipment brought into the safety cabinet must be cleaned and disinfected beforehand. Items of equipment removed from the safety cabinet must be disinfected and cleaned if necessary (in this order).\nThe working surface of the safety cabinet must be cleaned and disinfected at the end of the work. Waste must be disposed of, Pasteur pipettes on hoses must be removed and vacuum hoses must be disinfected (see operating instructions on hygiene and waste disposal). If flammable disinfectants are stipulated, disinfect only by wiping with quantities of less than 20 ml in order to prevent explosion. However, the flow in biosafety cabinet will cause alcohol evaporation and degrade the disinfecting capacity, therefore larger volume may be necessary to disinfect working cabinet after use.\nIf work is not being carried out under the safety cabinet, it should be switched to stand-by mode in order to save energy. Night mode can be switched on if the hood needs to be left over night and the work shall continue the following day.\nIf work involving potentially hazardous biological substances has been carried out, the equipment must be switched off only by an authorized person. The sterility of the inside should be monitored from time to time by placing open Petri dishes lined with nutrients there. If microorganism growth occurs on the nutrients, the Laboratory Manager and the responsible person must be informed in accordance with the service plan."

    "text": "Malfunctions and dangers\nSafe operation is only possible if the window sash is in a correct position and the display marks all zones as green. Never ignore alarm signals. The cabinet does not offer any protection against harmful gases and vapours. - In the event of a complete functional failure during work with potentially dangerous biological substances work must be stopped in a controlled manner. The laboratory manager and the BSO of the group must be informed immediately. - In the event of a visual and acoustic alarm, the cause of the malfunction must be identified, if necessary, with the help of the operating instructions and, if possible, corrected by the operator themselves. If it is not possible to correct the malfunction or if attempts are unsuccessful, the responsible person must be notified in accordance with the service plan. The most probable causes of alarms are: - obstructed flow - remove any items from the air intake; - incorrect windows sash position for given operational mode - check the position and the mode; - incorrect operational mode for given window sash position - check the position and the mode; - turbulent flow - wait until the system reestablishes correct mass flow and move slower so the contaminated air does not leave the cabinet. - If there is an indication that the preliminary filter or the HEPA filter needs to be replaced: - alarm signal without warning - work shall be continued and the responsible person must be notified in accordance with the service plan, so the new filters can be ordered and changed. - alarm signal with warning - work must be ended in a controlled manner and the responsible person must be notified in accordance with the service plan, so the new filters can be ordered and changed."
