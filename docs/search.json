Incorporated in the operational safety concept are measures of GHE for workplace safety and measures to keep people and the environment safe.\nThis operational safety concept of GHE is based on the document “Safety and Occupational Health, Manual on the implementation of EKAS Directive 6508”2 and the corresponding directive.\nThis safety concept is continuously updated when the risk situation has changed, primarily when new work methods are used, new materials are handled, new devices which are relevant for safety are used or when existing areas are repurposed, or new rooms are occupied but also when the respective activities, processes, facilities are no longer used."

For people without the ETH employment contract, e.g., students or guest scientists, the accident report goes to the respective health/accident insurance.\nTo improve the work safety standards in labs and workshops at ETH, SGU follows up on all kinds of incidents. Therefore, SGU would like to meet with the injured person to learn more about the accident and how it could have been prevented. This will help to take the right corrective and preventive measures for the future.\n\n\n4.3.2 Damage of material and equipment\nShould material damage, e.g., to research equipment, be caused by the incident, the damage must be reported via a damage report.

Should it be necessary for research purposes to procure or to build equipment without CE declaration of conformity, then a hazard assessment must be performed; responsible for this is the professor who takes on the responsibilities of the manufacturer and distributor.\nThe GSR stores the paper version of declarations of conformity for all the devices in his office (CLD D 2.1). The digital versions of certificates of conformity for the wet laboratory are available here.\nUser manuals for the equipment in the wet laboratory in their digital versions are stored here.\n\n6.4.1 Responsibility for equipment maintenance and upkeep\nAt GHE, all technical devices, operating equipment and tools are serviced regularly so that the quality of the research or diagnostic results, as well as the safety of employees and protection of persons and the environment in general, are guaranteed.\nMaintenance schedules for individual devices and delegation of responsibilities are set down in writing in Appendix 7."

Proposals for structural/technical modifications (to the infrastructure or changes in the locking system) are sent via the GMIS-System. GHE itself commissions modifications to devices, machines, experiments, and others.\nSafety Officers are always consulted whenever new building work or structural modifications are carried out at ETH Zurich and when technical changes are made to safety-relevant facilities9.\nIn the event of modifications, repurposing, dismantling, and relocating activities, specially adapted safety precautions must be taken at the required time, especially regarding the decontamination of labs and technical equipment. If, despite prior decontamination, a chemical hazard or similar risk cannot be completely ruled out, this aspect is explicitly regulated for the phase of construction work with the increased risk, e.g., dismantling filters."

    "text": "3.1 Responsibility and liability\nThe head of GHE assumes the operative responsibility for ensuring the safety of people, the environment, and safety at the workplace3. They ensure that the safety concept is implemented and followed and have established the organizational structure necessary for this purpose. At least one person has been entrusted with monitoring biological safety, the precise details concerning status, duties, and responsibilities have been set out in the job description. These job descriptions also specify the duties, tasks, and competencies of the laboratory managers and project leaders in everyday situations and emergencies. The job descriptions are an integral part of this specific biosafety concept. The necessary financial and personal resources to maintain biological and chemical safety are made available by GHE.\nAs a matter of principle, ETH Zurich as an institution (not an individual ETH employee) shall be held liable to third parties, both companies and persons. However, ETH may take recourse against employees who fail to comply with safety provisions deliberately or through gross negligence, thereby inflicting harm on a third party for which the ETH is liable. This covers the liability issue. The criminal law aspect must also be considered. Therefore, the following applies to all persons bearing responsibility for safety at ETH: The responsibility of persons under criminal law is derived from their sphere of responsibility concerning observing safety rules. Only those persons who, by their position, can prevent hazards through their intervention can be held accountable under criminal law. This is the case if they failed to intervene where intervention would have been appropriate and possible."
