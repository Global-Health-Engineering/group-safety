# Toluene

## Basic information

- Chemical formula(s): ${\rm C_7H_8}$, ${\rm C_6H_5CH_3}$
- Other names: methylbenzene, toluol, phenylmethane
- CAS: 108-88-3
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [0078](https://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0078.htm)
- Flammability: **yes - highly flammable**
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/4654) description: clear colourless liquid with a characteristic aromatic odour, less dense than water and insoluble in water, hence floats on water; vapours heavier than air; may be toxic by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 3** - it can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions. Its flash point is 4 °C. It's autoignition temperature is 480 °C.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against toluene for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **fair for limited service**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **poor (not recommended)**.
- Buthyl: **poor (not recommended)**.
- Nitrile: **fair for limited service**.
