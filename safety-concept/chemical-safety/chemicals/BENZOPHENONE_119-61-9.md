## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling benzophenone. [Apollo Scientific](https://store.apolloscientific.co.uk/storage/msds/OR8243_msds.pdf) provides the following recommendations:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: N/A
- Buthyl: **good**.
- Nitrile: **good**.
