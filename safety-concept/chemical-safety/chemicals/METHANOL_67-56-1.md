# Methanol

## Basic information

- Other names: methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, methyl hydrate
- CAS: 67-56-1
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [0057](https://inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0057.htm)
- Flammability: **yes - highly flammable**
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/3874) description: colourless fairly volatile liquid with a faintly sweet pungent odour, vapours slightly heavier than air may travel some distance to a source of ignition and flash back, accumulation of vapours may explode if ignited.

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 1** - exposure would cause irritation with only minor residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 3** - it can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions. Its flash point is 11-12 °C. It's autoignition temperature is between 385 and 470 °C.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against methanol for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **very good**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **very good**.
- Buthyl: **very good**.
- Nitrile: **very good**.
