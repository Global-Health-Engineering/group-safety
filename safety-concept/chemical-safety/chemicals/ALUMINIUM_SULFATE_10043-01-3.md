- CAS: 10043-01-3
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [1191](https://inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1191.htm)
- Flammability: no
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/8226) description: anhydrous is a white crystalline solid; soluble in water, nontoxic; immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the environment

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 1** - exposure would cause irritation with only minor residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling aluminium sulfate. [Gloves4U](https://www.gloves4u.eu/x/Chemical%20Resistant%20Chart%20-%20final%20(5).pdf) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, poor) for given chemical. The levels of protection against aluminium sulfate for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: **excellent**.
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **excellent**.
