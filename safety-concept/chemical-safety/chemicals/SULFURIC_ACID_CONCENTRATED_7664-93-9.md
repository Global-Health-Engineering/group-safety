## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 3** - short exposure could cause serious temporary or moderate residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 2** - undergoes violent chemical change at elevated temperatures and pressures, reacts violently with water, or may form explosive mixtures with water. 
- **Special notice (white):**
	- **W** - reacts with water in an unusual or dangerous manner.
	- **OX** - oxidizer - allows chemicals to burn without an air supply.

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against concentrated sulfuric acid for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **good**.
- Natural latex or rubber:  **good**.
- Buthyl:  **good**.
- Nitrile:  **good**.
