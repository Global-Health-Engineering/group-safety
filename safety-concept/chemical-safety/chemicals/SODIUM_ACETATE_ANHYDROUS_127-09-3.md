- **Health (blue): 1** - poses no health hazard, requires no precautions, and would offer no hazard beyond that of ordinary combustible materials.
- **Flammability (red): 1** - materials that require considerable preheating, under all ambient temperature conditions, before ignition and combustion can occur. Flash point above 250 °C.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against anhydrous sodium acetate for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **very good**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **very good**.
- Buthyl: **very good**.
- Nitrile: **very good**.
