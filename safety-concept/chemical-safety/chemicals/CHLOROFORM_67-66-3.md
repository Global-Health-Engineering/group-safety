- Flammability: no
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/2893) description: clear colourless liquid with a characteristic odour; denser than water and slightly soluble in water, hence sinks in water; nonflammable under most conditions, but burns under extreme conditions; may cause illness by inhalation, skin absorption or ingestion

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against chloroform for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **good for limited service**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **poor (not recommended)**.
- Buthyl: **poor (not recommended)**.
- Nitrile: **poor (not recommended)**.
