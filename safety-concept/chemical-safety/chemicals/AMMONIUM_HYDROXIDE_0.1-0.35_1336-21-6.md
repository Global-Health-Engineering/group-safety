## Basic information

- Chemical formula(s): ${\rm NH_3(aq)}$
- Other names: aqua ammonia, ammonium hydrate, ammonia aqueous solution (10-35%) 
- CAS: 1336-21-6
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [0215](https://inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0215.htm)
- Flammability: **yes - requires considerable preheating**

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 3** - short exposure could cause serious temporary or moderate residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 1** - requires considerable preheating, under all ambient temperature conditions, before ignition and combustion can occur. Flash point above 93.3 °C.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white):**
	- **COR** - corrosive, strong base.

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against 10% - 35% solution of ammonium hydroxide for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **very good**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **very good**.
- Buthyl: **very good**.
- Nitrile: **very good**.
