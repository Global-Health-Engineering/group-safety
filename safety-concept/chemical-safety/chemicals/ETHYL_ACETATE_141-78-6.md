## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against ethyl acetate for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **good for limited service**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **fair for limited service**.
- Buthyl: **good for limited service**.
- Nitrile: **fair for limited service**.
