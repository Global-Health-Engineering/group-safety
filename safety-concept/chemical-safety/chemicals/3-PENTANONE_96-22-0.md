## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling 3-pentanone. Safety data sheet from [Agilent](https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/msds/WRK-155E_NAEnglish.pdf) categorizes gloves for normal use and direct contact with the chemical. The levels of protection against 3-pentanone for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: N/A
- Buthyl: **good**, recommended for direct contact with the chemical, 240 min breakthrough time for 12-15 mil thickness.
- Nitrile: **fair**, but recommended for normal use - 60 min breakthrough time for  11-13 mil thickness.
