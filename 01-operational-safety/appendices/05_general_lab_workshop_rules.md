# General laboratory and workshop rules

## General
- Facilities are to be kept clean and orderly. Only the actually needed devices and materials are kept on the workbenches. Supplies are kept in the designated areas or in the cupboards.
- Doors and windows are kept shut while working. In the laboratory, when the fume hood or the biological cabinet are operating, the windows have to remain closed.
- Eating, drinking, and storing food or drink is prohibited in all laboratories and workshops.
- In laboratories and workshops, the appropriate protective clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn.
- Do not touch your mouth and eyes during work. Wash hands thoroughly after working and before leaving the premises.
- Cosmetics must not be used when working in the laboratory. 
- Work surfaces have to be decontaminated and cleaned regularly and after the work is finished. Only a suitable agent can be used. All lab chemicals are labeled, kept in suitable receptacles and never left open, except when actually using them.
- Pointed and sharp utensils should be avoided. Syringes and needles can only be used when justified. After use, they must be disposed of in the sharp disposal box.
- Storing and using personal items, e.g., bags, mobile phone, should be minimized in the work area.
- Before handling the chemicals and before working with machines and equipment, employees must be instructed/trained according to the workplace conditions and their previous knowledge. Work on certain machines, e.g., lathe, may only be performed by persons with appropriate training, e.g., mechanics with federal certificate of competence.
- Special waste must be collected according to the guidelines in the waste disposal concept.
- In case of an accident or an incident in the laboratory or workshop, procedures indicated on the emergency poster must be followed. Safety-relevant lab incidents are reported to the Group Safety Representative and SSHE.
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women may not handle metal powders nor lab chemicals. Exceptions are regulated in the Maternity Protection Ordinance. A risk analysis must be made according to [ETH information sheet: Maternity protection](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/associates/services/Service/sicherheit-gesundheit-umwelt/files/mutterschutz/en/Maternity_protection-factsheet.pdf).
- Before handling hazardous chemical substances and before carrying out experiments in which a hazardous substance could possibly be released, the risk potential must be determined and the necessary precautions taken. For activities with hazardous chemicals, the precautions described in the respective safety datasheets must be heeded and the rules of conduct for handling such substances must be specified in the individual user instructions and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
- Work with malodorous or toxic substances and highly flammable gases may only be performed inside the fume hood. The necessary protective measures must be taken into consideration. 
- Combustible fluids requiring refrigeration for storage, extremely flammable, and highly flammable substances may only be stored in explosionproof refrigerators or cabinets.
- Pressurized gas cylinders are always secured with a chain to protect against falling or stored and fastened with a chain in a gas cabinet. They may only be transported with the transport trolley specifically intended for this purpose and for the bottle size.

## Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Wear safety googles inside the laboratory or workshop, whenever any person in the same space is dealing with chemical, biological, or pressurized gas hazards. Persons using the corrective glasses can either wear corrective safety goggles or safety goggles over their own glasses. Contact lenses must not be worn, not even together with protective goggles.
- Lab coat must be worn when working in a lab in which chemical or biological materials are handled. The lab coat is buttoned up. Shorts and skirts are not allowed - legs must be completely covered by clothing (stockings, leggings or similar are not considered long trousers). Feet must be completely protected up to the ankle by suitable robust and closed flat-sole shoes. Bare feet, open-toe shoes, sandals, and high heels are not permitted.
- Lab coats must not to be worn outside the laboratory. Lab coat needs to be taken off before leaving the laboratory.
- Gloves must be worn for any activity involving risk (hand contamination or injury), e.g., when handling harmful chemicals, when dealing with high temperatures. Suitable protective gloves must be worn when working with lab chemicals (see the [safety datasheets](../../02-chemical-safety/README.md)). Contaminated gloves must be immediately replaced or cleaned. When using gloves, care should be taken not to transfer any metal powders or chemicals when using phones, opening doors, using water faucets, etc. Remove gloves beforehand!
- Depending on the hazards, additional PPE may be necessary for particular task, e.g., hearing protection, safety shoes, dust mask, gloves protecting against low or high temperatures, etc.
- Defective and expired PPE must be replaced and may not be used.
