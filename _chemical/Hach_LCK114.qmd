## Protective measures

### Gloves
Based on the safety data sheet recommendations for handling strong acids and toxic chemicals:

- **Viton™**: **very good** - recommended for long-term contact (>480 minutes breakthrough time, 0.70 mm thickness).
- **Nitrile**: **fair** - suitable for short-term contact only (>30 minutes breakthrough time, 0.20 mm thickness).
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **poor (not recommended)** - not suitable for acids.
- **Neoprene**: **fair to good** - moderate resistance to acids.

### Safety goggles
- Always wear chemical safety goggles or face shield when handling this product.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Handle only in a fume hood or with appropriate exhaust ventilation.

### Clothing
- Wear acid-resistant protective clothing and closed shoes.
- Long sleeves and full-length pants required.
- Contact lenses are forbidden while working with this product.
- Do not wear synthetic clothing that may melt if exposed to acid.
- Remove contaminated clothing immediately and wash before reuse.

### Respiratory protection
- Ensure adequate ventilation.
- If exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is experienced, use appropriate respiratory protection.
- Recommended filter type: ABEK-P3 for vapors/dusts/aerosols.

## Spill management
- Evacuate personnel to safe areas and ensure adequate ventilation.
- Use full personal protective equipment including acid-resistant gloves and clothing.
- Prevent entry into drains, sewers, or water bodies.
- Neutralize carefully with sodium bicarbonate or lime if safe to do so.
- Absorb with inert material (sand, vermiculite, acid binder).
- Collect in appropriate containers for disposal as hazardous waste.
- Never add water directly to concentrated acid spills.
- Contact emergency services immediately for large spills.
- Dispose according to local hazardous waste regulations.

## Special warnings
- **Contains mercury compounds** - extremely toxic, handle with extreme care.
- **Contains chromium(VI) compounds** - carcinogenic and mutagenic.
- **Reacts violently with water** - always add acid to water, never water to acid.
- **Restricted to professional users only**.
- Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated area away from incompatible materials.
- Keep away from bases, organic materials, reducing agents, and metals.
