- **Health (blue): 0** - poses no health hazard.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -** - no special hazards.

## Hazard statements
Sodium chloride has minimal hazard classification under GHS regulations:

| Code | Phrase                                                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| H319 | causes serious eye irritation                                 |

## Precautionary statements
| Code           | Phrase                                                                                                                         |

| P264           | wash hands thoroughly after handling                                                                                           |
| P280           | wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection                                                      |
| P305+P351+P338 | IF IN EYES: rinse cautiously with water for several minutes, remove contact lenses if present and easy to do, continue rinsing |
| P337+P313      | if eye irritation persists: get medical advice/attention                                                                       |

## Protective measures

### Gloves
For routine handling of sodium chloride:

- **Any standard laboratory gloves**: **very good** - sodium chloride is non-toxic and minimally irritating.
- **Nitrile**: **very good** - prevents contamination and provides good grip.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **very good** - adequate for handling salts.
- **Vinyl**: **very good** - suitable for food-grade applications.
- **PVC**: **good** - adequate protection for non-hazardous salts.

### Safety goggles
- Standard safety glasses recommended when handling powder to prevent eye irritation.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- **Important**: Can cause serious eye irritation if powder contacts eyes.

### Clothing
- Standard laboratory clothing is sufficient.
- Long sleeves recommended when handling large quantities to minimize skin contact with dust.
- Closed-toe shoes required as standard laboratory safety.
- No special protective clothing required for food-grade material.

### Respiratory protection
- Generally not required under normal use conditions.
- Dust mask recommended when handling large quantities of fine powder.
- Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent dust accumulation.
- Minimize dust generation during handling.

## Spill management
- Sweep up material carefully to minimize dust generation.
- Use vacuum with appropriate filtration if available.
- Avoid creating dust clouds during cleanup.
- Collect in appropriate container - can be disposed as non-hazardous waste.
- Clean area with water to remove residual salt.
- **Environmental consideration**: Avoid release to waterways in large quantities (can affect aquatic life).
- No special disposal requirements - non-hazardous material.

## Special warnings
- **Generally recognized as safe (GRAS)** - essential nutrient and food ingredient.
- **Eye irritant** - fine powder can cause serious eye irritation.
- **Hygroscopic** - absorbs moisture from air at high humidity (>75%).
- **Corrosive to metals** - concentrated solutions can corrode some metals over time.
- **De-icing agent** - can damage vegetation and corrode infrastructure if overused.
- Store in cool, dry place in tightly closed containers.
- **Food-grade vs. technical grade** - ensure appropriate grade for intended use.
- **Aquatic toxicity**: LC50 fish: 5,840 mg/L (96h), Daphnia: 874 mg/L (48h).
- **Medical note**: Excessive intake may contribute to hypertension in sensitive individuals.
- **Physical hazard**: Can make surfaces slippery when wet.
- Compatible with most materials under normal conditions.
