- **Health (blue): 0** - poses no health hazard.
- **Flammability (red): 1** - must be pre-heated before ignition can occur under typical fire conditions.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Hazard statements
Glucose is not classified as hazardous under GHS regulations. However, as a combustible organic powder, certain precautions apply:

| Code | Phrase |
| ---- | ------ |
| -    | No hazard statements assigned (not classified as hazardous) |

## Precautionary statements
Despite not being classified as hazardous, the following precautionary measures apply for combustible powders:

| Code           | Phrase                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| P280           | wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection                                                      |
| P370+P378      | in case of fire: use water spray, foam, dry powder, carbon dioxide for extinction                                              |
| P420           | store separately from incompatible materials                                                                                   |

## Protective measures

### Gloves
For routine handling of glucose powder:

- **Any standard laboratory gloves**: **very good** - glucose is non-toxic and non-irritating.
- **Nitrile**: **very good** - prevents contamination and provides grip.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **very good** - adequate for normal handling.
- **Vinyl**: **very good** - suitable for food-grade handling.

### Safety goggles
- Standard safety glasses recommended when handling large quantities to prevent eye irritation from dust.
- Not required for small quantities but good laboratory practice.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.

### Clothing
- Standard laboratory clothing is sufficient.
- Long sleeves recommended when handling large quantities to minimize skin contact with dust.
- Closed-toe shoes required as standard laboratory safety.
- No special protective clothing required.

### Respiratory protection
- Dust mask recommended when handling large quantities or in poorly ventilated areas.
- Minimize dust generation during handling.
- Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent dust accumulation.
- **Dust explosion hazard**: Prevent accumulation of airborne dust in confined spaces.

## Spill management
- Sweep up material carefully to minimize dust generation.
- Use non-sparking tools and avoid creating dust clouds.
- **Fire prevention**: Eliminate ignition sources during cleanup.
- Collect in appropriate container - can be disposed as non-hazardous waste.
- Clean area with damp cloth to remove residual dust.
- Ensure good ventilation during cleanup.
- No special disposal requirements - food-grade material.

## Special warnings
- **Combustible powder** - finely dispersed particles can form explosive mixtures in air.
- **Dust explosion hazard** - prevent accumulation of dust in confined spaces.
- **Reacts violently with strong oxidants** - store separately from oxidizing agents.
- **Generally recognized as safe (GRAS)** - approved food ingredient with very low toxicity.
- **Diabetic considerations** - large ingestion will raise blood glucose levels.
- Store in cool, dry place in tightly closed containers.
- **Hygroscopic** - absorbs moisture from air, may cake if stored improperly.
- Keep away from heat sources and ignition sources.
- Use closed systems and dust explosion-proof electrical equipment when handling large quantities.
- **No open flames** during handling of powder.
