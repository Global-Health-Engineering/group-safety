## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

![](../media/nfpa704/010.png){width=15% fig-align="center"}

- **Health (blue): 0** - poses no health hazard.
- **Flammability (red): 1** - must be pre-heated before ignition can occur (probably combustible).
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Hazard statements
Agar is **not classified** as hazardous under GHS regulations. Therefore, no H-codes are assigned.

## Precautionary statements
Despite not being classified as hazardous, the following general precautionary measures apply for organic powder handling:

## Protective measures

### Gloves
- **Any standard laboratory gloves**: **very good** - agar is non-toxic and non-irritating.
- **Nitrile**: **very good** - prevents contamination and provides good grip with powders.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **very good** - adequate for food-grade material handling.
- **Vinyl**: **very good** - suitable for food-grade applications.
- **PVC**: **good** - adequate protection for non-hazardous powder.

### Safety goggles
- Standard safety glasses recommended when handling large quantities to prevent dust irritation.
- Not required for small quantities but good laboratory practice.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Dust may cause mechanical irritation to eyes.

### Clothing
- Standard laboratory clothing is sufficient.
- Long sleeves recommended when handling large quantities to minimize dust contact.
- Closed-toe shoes required as standard laboratory safety.
- No special protective clothing required for food-grade material.

### Respiratory protection
- Dust mask recommended when handling large quantities or in poorly ventilated areas.
- **Low hazard** for usual industrial handling but minimize dust generation.
- Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent dust accumulation.
- Use full-face respirator if exposure limits are exceeded or irritation occurs.

## Spill management
- Sweep up material carefully to minimize dust generation.
- Use vacuum with appropriate filtration if available.
- Avoid creating dust clouds during cleanup.
- Collect in appropriate container - can be disposed as non-hazardous waste.
- Clean area with damp cloth to remove residual dust.
- **Biodegradable** - environmentally safe material.
- No special disposal requirements - food-grade material.

## Special warnings
- **Generally recognized as safe (GRAS)** - approved food ingredient and pharmaceutical excipient.
- **Practically non-toxic** - oral LD50 >15 g/kg (more than 1 quart for 70 kg person).
- **Passes through intestinal tract mostly unabsorbed** - minimal systemic toxicity.
- **Dust irritation** - may cause mechanical irritation to eyes and respiratory tract.
- **Hygroscopic** - absorbs moisture from air, store in dry conditions.
- Store in cool, dry place in tightly closed containers.
- **Incompatible with strong oxidizing agents** - standard organic material precaution.
- **Fire extinguishing**: Use dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or foam extinguisher.
- **WHMIS classification**: Not controlled (minimal regulatory requirements).
- **Water hazard class 2** - slightly hazardous to water (WGK Germany rating).
- **Derived from natural source** - red algae (Rhodophyta) cell walls.
