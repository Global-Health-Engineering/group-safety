- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 4** - rapidly or completely vaporize at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, or is readily dispersed in air and will burn readily.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white):**
	- **SA** - simple asphyxiant gas - a nontoxic or minimally toxic gas which reduces or displaces the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air.

## Protective measures

### Gloves
No skin protection necessary.

### Safety goggles
- Always wear safety goggles when handling methane. Corrective glasses are not considered safety googles.
- Handle methane inside the fume hood only.

### Clothing
- Wear long trousers and fully covered shoes.
- Contact lenses are forbidden while working with chemical substances, even in combination with safety glasses.
- Do not wear cosmetics.
- Do not wear synthetic clothing while working with flammable liquids or gases or when a hazard is present as these materials tend to melt and stick to exposed skin.
- Do not wear headphones.

## Spill management
Not applicable.
