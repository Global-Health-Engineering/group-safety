## Protective measures

### Gloves
For routine handling of potassium phosphate powder:

- **Any standard laboratory gloves**: **very good** - potassium phosphate is minimally irritating.
- **Nitrile**: **very good** - prevents contamination and provides good chemical resistance.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **very good** - adequate for handling salts.
- **PVC**: **good** - suitable for handling non-hazardous salts.
- **Vinyl**: **good** - adequate for food-grade applications.

### Safety goggles
- Standard safety glasses recommended when handling powder to prevent eye irritation.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Eye protection particularly important as powder may cause irritation.

### Clothing
- Standard laboratory clothing is sufficient.
- Long sleeves recommended when handling large quantities to minimize skin contact with dust.
- Closed-toe shoes required as standard laboratory safety.
- Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse.

### Respiratory protection
- Ensure adequate ventilation when handling large quantities.
- Use dust mask when working with fine powder in poorly ventilated areas.
- **Harmful airborne particles can accumulate quickly** when powder is dispersed.
- Minimize dust generation during handling.

## Spill management
- Sweep up material carefully to minimize dust generation.
- Use vacuum with appropriate filtration if available.
- Avoid creating dust clouds during cleanup.
- Collect in appropriate container - can be disposed as non-hazardous waste.
- Clean area with water to remove residual powder.
- **Weakly acidic in solution** - neutralize large spills if necessary.
- No special disposal requirements - non-hazardous material.

## Special warnings
- **Decomposes on heating** - produces toxic and irritating phosphorus oxide fumes.
- **Weakly acidic** - aqueous solutions have pH around 4.2-4.7.
- **May cause irritation** - to eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.
- **Hygroscopic** - absorbs moisture from air, store in tightly closed containers.
- Store in cool, dry place away from strong bases.
- **Food additive** - generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in foods.
- **Buffer component** - commonly used with disodium phosphate for pH control.
- **Fertilizer use** - source of potassium and phosphorus for plants.
- **Incompatible with strong bases** - may react to form heat.
- Symptoms of exposure: cough, redness, pain (eyes/skin), abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea if ingested in large amounts.
