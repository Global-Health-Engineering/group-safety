- **Health (blue): 1** - exposure would cause irritation with only minor residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 3** - it can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions. Its flash point is -4 °C. It's autoignition temperature is 426 °C.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Protective measures

### Gloves
[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against ethyl acetate for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprene: **good for limited service**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **fair for limited service**.
- Buthyl: **good for limited service**.
- Nitrile: **fair for limited service**.

### Safety goggles
- Always wear safety goggles when handling ethyl acetate. Corrective glasses are not considered safety googles.
- Handle ethyl acetate inside the fume hood only (with exception of moving the closed bottle to and from the storage cabinet).

### Clothing
- Wear long trousers and fully covered shoes.
- Contact lenses are forbidden while working with chemical substances, even in combination with safety glasses.
- Do not wear cosmetics.
- Do not wear synthetic clothing while working with flammable liquids or gases or when a hazard is present as these materials tend to melt and stick to exposed skin.
- Do not wear headphones.

## Spill management
- Use personal protective equipment.
- Avoid dust formation, avoid breathing dust.
- Avoid breathing vapors or mist.
- Ensure adequate ventilation.
- Evacuate personnel to safe areas.
- Sweep up without creating dust and arrange disposal.
- Do not let it enter drain.
- If a spill happened outside the fume hood (on the floor or desktop) contact Dr Jakub Tkaczuk (+41 44 632 31 62) and the ETH Emergency Desk (+41 44 342 11 88 from mobile or 888 from landline).
