## Protective measures

### Gloves
- **Viton™**: **very good** - recommended for long-term contact (>480 minutes breakthrough time, 0.70 mm thickness).
- **Nitrile**: **good** - suitable for short-term contact (>30 minutes breakthrough time, 0.40 mm thickness).
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **fair** - adequate for brief contact with moderate acid solutions.
- **Butyl rubber**: **good** - chemical resistant gloves category III according to EN 374-1:2016.

### Safety goggles
- Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles) when handling this product.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Handle with adequate ventilation.

### Clothing
