- **Health (blue): 1** - poses no health hazard, requires no precautions, and would offer no hazard beyond that of ordinary combustible materials.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Hazard statements
Potassium chloride is **not classified** as a hazardous substance according to GHS (Globally Harmonized System). Therefore, no H-codes are assigned.

| P302+P352      | IF ON SKIN: wash with plenty of water                                                                                         |
| P304+P340      | IF INHALED: remove person to fresh air and keep comfortable for breathing                                                     |
| P305+P351+P338 | IF IN EYES: rinse cautiously with water for several minutes, remove contact lenses if present and easy to do, continue rinsing |

## Protective measures

### Gloves
For routine handling of potassium chloride powder or solutions:

- **Nitrile**: **good** - suitable for routine handling and protection from dust.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **good** - adequate for normal contact.
- **PVC**: **fair** - suitable for basic protection.
- **Leather work gloves**: **poor** - not recommended for chemical handling.

### Safety goggles
- Wear safety glasses with side shields when handling powder to prevent eye irritation from dust.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Standard safety glasses adequate for routine use.

### Clothing
- Wear long sleeves and long pants to minimize skin contact with dust.
- Standard laboratory clothing is sufficient.
- Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse.
- Closed-toe shoes required.

### Respiratory protection
- Ensure adequate ventilation when handling large quantities.
- Use dust mask if working with fine powder in poorly ventilated areas.
- N95 respirator recommended for handling large quantities of fine powder.

## Spill management
- Use standard cleanup procedures for non-hazardous materials.
- Sweep up or vacuum material and place in appropriate waste container.
- Avoid creating dust clouds during cleanup.
- Use water to dampen material if dusty conditions exist.
- Clean area with water after material removal.
- Dispose according to local waste management regulations.
- No special disposal requirements - can typically be disposed as non-hazardous waste.

## Special warnings
- **Generally recognized as safe (GRAS)** - potassium chloride is used as a food additive and salt substitute.
- **Low toxicity** - oral LD50 in rats: 2600 mg/kg, indicating low acute toxicity.
- **May cause mild irritation** - dust may cause minor irritation to eyes, skin, or respiratory tract.
- **Hygroscopic** - absorbs moisture from air, store in tightly closed containers.
- Store in cool, dry place away from moisture.
- Compatible with most materials - no significant incompatibilities under normal conditions.
- **Large ingestion may cause gastrointestinal irritation** - though this is unlikely in laboratory quantities.
