## Protective measures

### Gloves
- **Nitrile**: **very good** - chemical resistant protective gloves recommended for handling toxic components.
- **Butyl rubber**: **very good** - excellent protection against sodium hydroxide and toxic reagents.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **fair** - adequate for brief contact but not recommended for extended use.
- **PVC**: **fair** - provides basic protection but limited chemical resistance.

### Safety goggles
- **Mandatory**: Always wear safety glasses with side-shields when handling.
- Strong alkaline solution (pH 12.5) and toxic components require eye protection.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Part 1/2 may cause severe eye damage, Part 2/2 causes irritation.

### Clothing
- Wear protective clothing to prevent skin contact.
- Long sleeves and full-length pants required.
- Closed-toe shoes mandatory.
- Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
- **Caustic hazard**: Part 1/2 contains sodium hydroxide which causes severe burns.

### Respiratory protection
- Use only in well-ventilated areas.
- **Toxic if inhaled** - avoid breathing vapors from Part 2/2.
- **Contact with acids liberates toxic gas** - ensure proper ventilation.
- Use appropriate respiratory protection if ventilation is insufficient.

## Spill management
- Use personal protective equipment including chemical resistant gloves and eye protection.
- **Do not flush** into surface water or sanitary sewer system.
- Soak up with inert absorbent material and dispose as hazardous waste.
- **Part 2/2**: Use mechanical handling equipment to avoid dust generation.
- **Highly water contaminating** - prevent environmental release.
- **Never mix with acids** - may generate toxic chlorine gas.
- Dispose according to waste code 160506 (hazardous laboratory chemicals).

## Special warnings
- **Two-part system** - each part has different hazards and handling requirements.
- **Part 1/2 (Sample cuvette)**: Contains sodium hydroxide (<0.2%), pH 12.5, causes severe burns (R35).
- **Part 2/2 (DosiCapZip)**: Contains toxic sodium nitroprusside (12%) - toxic if swallowed (R25).
- **Generates toxic gas** - contact with acids liberates toxic gas (cyanide compounds).
- **Aquatic toxicity**: Very toxic to aquatic organisms with long-lasting effects.
- **Storage**: Keep in dry, cool place (2-8°C for refrigerated storage).
- **Highly water contaminating class 3** - prevent release to environment.
- **Chlorine generation**: Part 2/2 may develop chlorine if mixed with acidic solutions.
- **Professional use only** - water analysis reagent for laboratory use.
- **Disposal**: Local Hach agencies will accept used cuvettes for proper disposal.
