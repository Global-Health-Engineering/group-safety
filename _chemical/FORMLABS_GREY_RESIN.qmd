## Protective measures

### Gloves
Based on the safety data sheet recommendations for handling photopolymer resins:

- **Nitrile**: **very good** - chemical resistant, impervious gloves recommended for handling acrylate resins.
- **Butyl rubber**: **good** - chemical resistant gloves suitable for extended contact.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **poor (not recommended)** - not suitable for handling methacrylate compounds.
- **Viton™**: **very good** - excellent chemical resistance.

### Safety goggles
- Always wear safety glasses or goggles when handling this product.
- Use eye protection equipment that has been tested and approved by recognized national standards.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.

### Clothing
- Wear chemical resistant protective clothing.
- Long sleeves and full-length pants required.
- Avoid skin contact - remove contaminated clothing immediately.
- Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.
- Do not allow contaminated work clothing out of the workplace.

### Respiratory protection
- Use with adequate ventilation.
- If engineering controls do not maintain airborne concentrations below applicable limits, wear approved respirator.
- Emergency eye wash stations and safety showers should be available.

## Spill management
- Evacuate unnecessary personnel and ventilate area.
- Extinguish any sources of ignition.
- Wear recommended personal protective equipment.
- Stop leak if safe to do so.
- Prevent from reaching drains, sewers and waterways.
- Contain and collect spillage and place in suitable container for disposal.
- Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing.
- Do not touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing.
- Dispose according to local hazardous waste regulations.

## Special warnings
- **May cause allergic skin reaction** - skin sensitization can occur, discontinue use if sensitization develops.
- **Causes serious eye irritation** - avoid contact with eyes.
- **Toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects** - prevent release to environment.
- **Avoid exposure to light and heat** - store below 38°C (100°F) away from direct sunlight.
- **Incompatible with peroxides, strong oxidizing agents, alcohols, copper, and strong bases**.
- Keep containers tightly closed when not in use.
- Use only in well-ventilated areas.
