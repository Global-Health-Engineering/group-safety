- **Health (blue): 1** - poses no health hazard, requires no precautions, and would offer no hazard beyond that of ordinary combustible materials.
- **Flammability (red): 1** - must be pre-heated before ignition can occur (flash point 176°C).
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Hazard statements
Glycerol is not classified as hazardous under GHS regulations. However, as a combustible liquid, certain precautions apply:

| Code | Phrase |
| ---- | ------ |
| -    | No hazard statements assigned (not classified as hazardous) |

## Precautionary statements
Despite not being classified as hazardous, the following precautionary measures apply for combustible liquids:

| Code           | Phrase                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| P210           | keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces - no smoking                                                             |
| P280           | wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection                                                      |
| P370+P378      | in case of fire: use water spray, foam, dry powder, carbon dioxide for extinction                                            |
| P403+P235      | store in a well-ventilated place, keep cool                                                                                  |

## Protective measures

### Gloves
For routine handling of glycerol:

- **Any standard laboratory gloves**: **very good** - glycerol is non-toxic and non-irritating.
- **Nitrile**: **very good** - prevents skin defatting and provides good grip.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **very good** - adequate for normal handling.
- **PVC**: **good** - suitable for handling viscous liquids.
- **Vinyl**: **good** - adequate for food-grade applications.

### Safety goggles
- Standard safety glasses recommended when handling to prevent eye contact.
- Not required for small quantities but good laboratory practice.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Eye protection particularly important due to viscous nature.

### Clothing
- Standard laboratory clothing is sufficient.
- Long sleeves recommended to prevent prolonged skin contact.
- Closed-toe shoes required as standard laboratory safety.
- **Hygroscopic material** - may cause skin dryness with prolonged contact.

### Respiratory protection
- Generally not required under normal use conditions.
- Ensure adequate ventilation when heating (produces acrolein fumes).
- Use appropriate ventilation when handling large quantities.
- **Important**: Heating above 176°C requires fume hood due to acrolein formation.

## Spill management
- Clean up spills immediately to prevent slipping hazard (viscous liquid).
- Absorb with inert material or mop up with water.
- **Fire prevention**: Eliminate ignition sources during cleanup.
- Wash area with water to remove residual glycerol.
- **Slippery when wet** - use caution on wet surfaces.
- No special disposal requirements - can be disposed with water or as non-hazardous waste.
- Biodegradable and environmentally safe.

## Special warnings
- **Hygroscopic** - absorbs moisture from air, may dilute over time if container not sealed.
- **Combustible liquid** - flash point 176°C, auto-ignition temperature 393°C.
- **Heating hazard** - produces toxic acrolein fumes when heated above decomposition temperature.
- **Generally recognized as safe (GRAS)** - approved food ingredient and pharmaceutical excipient.
- **Skin drying** - prolonged contact may cause dry skin due to hygroscopic properties.
- **Laxative effect** - ingestion of large quantities may cause diarrhea.
- Store in tightly closed containers to prevent moisture absorption.
- **Incompatible with strong oxidants** - may cause fire and explosion risk.
- Keep away from heat sources when stored.
- **Slippery** - clean up spills immediately to prevent falls.
- Explosive limits in air: 2.6-11.3 vol% (when heated to form vapor).
