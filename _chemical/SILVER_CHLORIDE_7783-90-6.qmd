- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Protective measures

### Gloves
For handling silver chloride powder or solutions:

- **Nitrile**: **very good** - chemical resistant and prevents skin contact with silver compounds.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **good** - adequate for routine handling.
- **PVC**: **good** - suitable for handling silver chloride.
- **Butyl rubber**: **very good** - excellent chemical resistance for extended contact.

### Safety goggles
- Always wear safety glasses or goggles when handling this product.
- Use eye protection equipment that has been tested and approved by recognized national standards.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Prevent eye contact to avoid irritation.

### Clothing
- Wear protective clothing to prevent skin contact.
- Long sleeves and full-length pants required.
- Closed-toe shoes mandatory.
- Remove contaminated clothing immediately and wash before reuse.
- Prevent skin contact as silver compounds may cause discoloration.

### Respiratory protection
- Ensure adequate ventilation when handling.
- Use dust mask when working with fine powder to prevent inhalation.
- For large quantities or poor ventilation, use appropriate respiratory protection.
- Minimize dust generation during handling.

## Spill management
- **Prevent environmental release** - silver chloride is very toxic to aquatic life.
- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.
- Collect spillage using non-sparking tools (avoid metal tools that may react).
- Sweep up material carefully to avoid creating dust.
- Place collected material in appropriate container for disposal.
- Do not wash spills down drains or allow entry into waterways.
- Clean area thoroughly after material removal.
- **Special disposal requirements** - dispose as hazardous waste according to local regulations.
- Contact environmental authorities for guidance on large spills.

## Special warnings
- **Very toxic to aquatic life** - prevent release to environment, waterways, or soil.
- **Photosensitive** - darkens when exposed to light due to decomposition to metallic silver.
- **Argyria risk** - prolonged exposure to silver compounds may cause irreversible blue-gray discoloration of skin and eyes.
- **Insoluble in water** - forms stable suspensions that can persist in aquatic environments.
- Store in dark, cool, dry place in tightly closed containers.
- Keep away from light to prevent photochemical decomposition.
- **Incompatible with ammonia** - forms explosive silver-ammonia compounds.
- **Incompatible with cyanides** - may form toxic hydrogen cyanide gas.
- Handle with non-metallic tools when possible to prevent contamination.
- **Regulated waste** - requires special disposal as hazardous waste due to silver content.
