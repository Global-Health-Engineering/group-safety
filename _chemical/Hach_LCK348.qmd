## Protective measures

### Gloves
Based on the safety data sheet recommendations for handling dilute acids:

- **Viton™**: **very good** - recommended for long-term contact (>480 minutes breakthrough time, 0.70 mm thickness).
- **Nitrile**: **good** - suitable for short-term contact (>30 minutes breakthrough time, 0.40 mm thickness).
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **fair** - adequate for brief contact with dilute acid solutions.
- **Butyl rubber**: **good** - chemical resistant gloves category III according to EN 374-1:2016.

### Safety goggles
- Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles) when handling this product.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Handle with adequate ventilation.

### Clothing
- Wear suitable protective clothing and closed shoes.
- Long sleeves and full-length pants recommended.
- Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.

### Respiratory protection
- Ensure adequate ventilation.
- No protective equipment is needed under normal use conditions.
- If exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is experienced, use appropriate respiratory protection.
- Recommended filter type: ABEK-P3 if respirator is needed.

## Spill management
- Avoid contact with skin, eyes or clothing.
- Ensure adequate ventilation.
- Use personal protective equipment as required.
- Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.
- Soak up with inert absorbent material (sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust).
- Take up mechanically, placing in appropriate containers for disposal.
- Clean contaminated objects and areas thoroughly observing environmental regulations.
- Dispose according to local hazardous waste regulations.

## Special warnings
- **Causes mild skin irritation** - avoid prolonged contact.
- **May be corrosive to metals** - store in appropriate containers.
- Keep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place.
- Keep out of the reach of children.
- Store away from other materials.
- **Corrosive to metals** - steel corrosion rate 28.9 mm/yr.
