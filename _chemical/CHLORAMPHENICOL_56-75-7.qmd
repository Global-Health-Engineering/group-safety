## Protective measures

### Gloves
For handling chloramphenicol powder (carcinogenic substance):

- **Nitrile**: **very good** - recommended for handling carcinogenic materials, chemical resistant.
- **Butyl rubber**: **very good** - excellent chemical resistance for extended contact with carcinogens.
- **Viton™**: **very good** - superior chemical resistance for hazardous substances.
- **Natural latex or rubber**: **poor (not recommended)** - inadequate protection against carcinogens.
- **PVC**: **fair** - limited protection, not recommended for carcinogens.

### Safety goggles
- **Mandatory**: Always wear chemical safety goggles when handling this product.
- Use eye protection equipment that has been tested and approved by recognized national standards.
- Corrective glasses are not considered safety goggles.
- Handle only in well-ventilated areas or fume hood.

### Clothing
- **Mandatory protective clothing**: Wear chemical resistant protective clothing.
- Long sleeves and full-length pants required.
- Closed-toe shoes mandatory.
- **Disposable clothing recommended** when handling carcinogenic materials.
- Remove contaminated clothing immediately and dispose properly.
- Do not take contaminated clothing home.

### Respiratory protection
- **Mandatory**: Use appropriate respiratory protection when handling.
- Use HEPA-filtered respirator or work in fume hood.
- Minimize dust generation during handling.
- Ensure adequate ventilation with HEPA or charcoal filtration.
- **Never eat, drink, or smoke** while handling.

## Spill management
- **Evacuate area** and restrict access to trained personnel only.
- Wear full protective equipment including respirator.
- **Minimize dust generation** - do not sweep dry material.
- Use wet cleanup methods or vacuum with HEPA filter.
- Collect material in sealed containers labeled for carcinogenic waste.
- **Special disposal required** - handle as hazardous carcinogenic waste.
- Decontaminate area thoroughly after cleanup.
- **Never wash down drains** or dispose in regular waste.

## Special warnings
- **IARC Group 2A carcinogen** - probable human carcinogen.
- **Suspected reproductive toxin** - may damage fertility or unborn child.
- **Causes aplastic anemia** - potentially fatal blood disorder.
- **Organ damage** - causes damage through prolonged or repeated exposure.
- **Restricted use** - handle only by trained personnel with appropriate safety measures.
- Store in locked, secure area away from unauthorized personnel.
- **Medical surveillance required** for personnel with occupational exposure.
- Keep exposure logs and provide medical monitoring.
- **Pregnancy warning** - pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle.
- Use only in well-ventilated areas with HEPA filtration.
- **Emergency procedures** - have emergency eyewash and shower available.
- **Special training required** before handling this carcinogenic substance.
