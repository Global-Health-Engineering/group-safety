Safety data sheets are available in this repository. The pdf version of safety data sheets is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bJF0D2jVyDl7N-xR_PSAPsDRH4nG7PFN?usp=sharing). Safety data sheets are also available in the laboratory in printed form. All laboratory users are informed on how to find this information.

## 2. Storage/quantities

Chemicals are kept in the laboratories of GHE in the quantities necessary for uninterrupted daily working. Highly flammable liquids are kept in a suitable, marked cabinets or cabinet compartment. The long-term storage facility is located outside the laboratory and complies with the fire regulations. The relevant guidelines of the Federal Coordination Commission for Occupational Safety are complied with. When handling and storing chemicals, GHE follows the stipulations of the relevant safety datasheets, filed in this repository.

The chemical inventory is carried out twice per year. Chemicals no longer required or expired (time limit of maximum five years) are sorted out and disposed of as hazardous waste.

## 3. Disposal

Chemical wastes, strong acids, bases, (chlorinated) organic solvents, toxic substances are collected and disposed of according to the disposal concept applicable throughout the ETH. ETH Zurich has an appropriate collection point for depositing hazardous waste. The ETH disposal guidelines are available [here](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/associates/services/Service/sicherheit-gesundheit-umwelt/files/sonderabfall_neu/en/Richtlinie_Entsorgung_EN.pdf).

## 4. Code

`src/populate_hazards_precautions.py` contains a piece of helper code to populate the hazard and precaution tables in material-specific `md` files.

[^1]: Material categories: (1) explosive materials; (2) gases; (3) flammable liquids; (4.1) flammable solids; (4.2) pyrophorics or self-heating substances; (4.3) hazardous substances that develop flammable gases in contact with water; (5.1) oxidizing substances; (5.2) organic peroxides and self-reactive substances; (6.1) toxic substances; (6.2) infectious substances; (7) radioactive substances; (8) corrosive and caustic substances; (10/12) other liquids with hazard symbols; (11/13) other solids with hazard symbols; (N/A) not hazardous.
[^2]: Substance classification for their carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or toxicity for reproduction by the [International Agency for Research on Cancer](https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications/). The CMR categories are: (1) carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic to humans; (2A) probably carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic to humans; (2B) possibly carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic to humans; (3) not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or reproductive toxicity to humans; (4) probably not carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic to humans.
