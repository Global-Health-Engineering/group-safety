## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 3** - short exposure could cause serious temporary or moderate residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 1** - normally stable, but can become unstable at elevated temperatures and pressures.
- **Special notice (white):**
	- **ALK** - alkaline.

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) categorize gloves into four protection levels (very good, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against sodium hydroxide for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **very good**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **very good**.
- Buthyl: **very good**.
- Nitrile: **very good**.
