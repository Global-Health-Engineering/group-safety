## Protective measures

### Gloves
[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling magnesium oxide. [Carl Roth](https://www.carlroth.com/medias/SDB-8280-IE-EN.pdf?context=bWFzdGVyfHNlY3VyaXR5RGF0YXNoZWV0c3wyMTY3NDZ8YXBwbGljYXRpb24vcGRmfHNlY3VyaXR5RGF0YXNoZWV0cy9oYmMvaDc3LzkwODI5NDk5NTk3MTAucGRmfDVhYzg2NGYyZjBmODczMTg1MzhkZDFiZDllZWU5MWJiOWE2ZTk2YjBkYTNjMjQ2ZGI2ZGJkNDFkM2UyOWMwZTU) specifies only the nitrile gloves as a PPE against magnesium oxide:

- Neoprene: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: N/A
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **very good**.

### Safety goggles
- Always wear safety goggles when handling magnesium oxide. Corrective glasses are not considered safety googles.
- Handle magnesium oxide inside the fume hood only (with exception of moving the closed bottle to and from the storage cabinet).

### Clothing
- Wear long trousers and fully covered shoes.
- Contact lenses are forbidden while working with chemical substances, even in combination with safety glasses.
- Do not wear cosmetics.
- Do not wear synthetic clothing while working with flammable liquids or gases or when a hazard is present as these materials tend to melt and stick to exposed skin.
- Do not wear headphones.

## Spill management
- Use personal protective equipment.
- Avoid dust formation, avoid breathing dust.
- Avoid breathing vapors or mist.
- Ensure adequate ventilation.
- Evacuate personnel to safe areas.
- Sweep up without creating dust and arrange disposal.
- Do not let it enter drain.
- If a spill happened outside the fume hood (on the floor or desktop) contact Dr Jakub Tkaczuk (+41 44 632 31 62) and the ETH Emergency Desk (+41 44 342 11 88 from mobile or 888 from landline).
