## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling methyl salicylate. [Becky](https://becky.ee/useful-articles/chemical-resistance-table-for-gloves/?lang=en), a PPE distributor, categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, not recommended) for given chemical. The levels of protection against methyl salicylate for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **fair**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **fair**.
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **good**.
