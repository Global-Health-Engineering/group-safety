## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling methyl stearate. [TRC](https://www.trc-canada.com/prod-img/MSDS/M326690MSDS.pdf) provides information on two types of gloves protecting against exposure to methyl stearate:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: N/A
- Buthyl: **immersion protection with 4/8 mil thickness**
- Nitrile: **splash protection with 15 mil thickness**
