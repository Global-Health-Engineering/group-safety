# Methane

## Basic information

- Chemical formula(s): ${\rm CH_4}$
- Other names: methyl hydride, marsh gas
- CAS: 74-82-8
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [0291](https://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0291.htm)
- Flammability: **yes - highly flammable**
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/8823) description: colourless odourless gas; easily ignited; vapors lighter than air; under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 4** - rapidly or completely vaporize at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, or is readily dispersed in air and will burn readily.
- **Instabilityâ€“reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white):**
	- **SA** - simple asphyxiant gas - a nontoxic or minimally toxic gas which reduces or displaces the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air.
