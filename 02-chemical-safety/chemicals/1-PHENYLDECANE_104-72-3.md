## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling 1-phenyldecane. [Sigma Aldrich](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CH/en/sds/aldrich/113212) provides the following information:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: N/A
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **very good protection;** 480 min breakthrough time for 0.4 mm thickness.
