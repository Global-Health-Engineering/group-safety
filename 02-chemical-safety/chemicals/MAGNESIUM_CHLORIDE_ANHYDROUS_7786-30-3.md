## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling anhydrous magnesium chloride. [Gloves4U](https://www.gloves4u.eu/x/Chemical%20Resistant%20Chart%20-%20final%20(5).pdf) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against anhydrous magnesium chloride for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **good**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **excellent**.
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **excellent**.
