## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.

- **Special notice (white):**
	- **OX** - oxidizer - allows chemicals to burn without air supply.

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling sodium hypochlorite. [California State University](https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/safety/documents/gloves.htm) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against sodium hypochlorite for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: **excellent**.
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **excellent**.
