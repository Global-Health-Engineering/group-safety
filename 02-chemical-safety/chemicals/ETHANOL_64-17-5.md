## Basic information

- Chemical formula(s): ${\rm C_2H_6O}$, ${\rm CH_3CH_2OH}$, ${\rm C_2H_5OH}$
- Other names: ethyl alcohol, absolute ethanol, methyl carbinol, grain alcohol
- CAS: 64-17-5
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [0044](https://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0044.htm)
- Flammability: **yes - highly flammable**
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/667) description: clear colourless liquid with a characteristic vinous odour and pungent taste, vapours are heavier than air

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 2** - exposure would cause irritation with only minor residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 3** - it can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions. Its flash point is -26 °C. It's autoignition temperature is 234 °C.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling ethanol solution. [California State University](https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/safety/documents/gloves.htm) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against ethanol solution for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: **good**.
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **good**.
