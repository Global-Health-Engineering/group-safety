## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling 1,1,1-trichloroethane. [California State University](https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/safety/documents/gloves.htm) (CSU) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, poor (not recommended)) for given chemical. The levels of protection against 1,1,1-trichloroethane for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: N/A
- Natural latex or rubber: **poor (not recommended)**.
- Buthyl: N/A
- Nitrile: **poor (not recommended)**.
- *CSU suggests using Viton gloves and classifies the provided protection as **good**.*
