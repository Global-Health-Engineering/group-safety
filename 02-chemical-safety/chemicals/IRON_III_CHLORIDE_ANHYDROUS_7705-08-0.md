## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling iron(III) chloride. [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/services/ehs/chemsafe/PDF%20files/gloveselechart.pdf) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, not recommended) for given chemical. The levels of protection against iron(III) chloride for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: **excellent**.
- Natural latex or rubber: **excellent**.
- Buthyl: **excellent**.
- Nitrile: **excellent**.
