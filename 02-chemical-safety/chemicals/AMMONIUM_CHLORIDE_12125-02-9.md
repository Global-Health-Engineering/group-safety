## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 2** - intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white): -**

## Skin protection (gloves)

[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf) and [OSHA Glove Selection Chart](https://safety.fsu.edu/safety_manual/OSHA%20Glove%20Selection%20Chart.pdf) do not provide recommendation on gloves for handling ammonium chloride. [Gloves4U](https://www.gloves4u.eu/x/Chemical%20Resistant%20Chart%20-%20final%20(5).pdf) categorizes gloves into four protection levels (excellent, good, fair, poor) for given chemical. The levels of protection against ammonium chloride for four types of gloves are:

- Neoprane: N/A.
- Natural latex or rubber: **excellent**.
- Buthyl: N/A.
- Nitrile: **good**.
