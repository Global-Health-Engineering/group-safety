# Oxygen gaseous

## Basic information

- Chemical formula(s): ${\rm O_2}$
- Other names: -
- CAS: 7782-41-7
- International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC): [0138](http://www.ilo.org/dyn/icsc/showcard.display?p_version=2&p_card_id=0138&p_lang=en)
- Flammability: no
- [NOAA's](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/8967) description: colourless, odourless, and tasteless gas; noncombustible, but actively supports the burning of combustible materials; some materials that don not burn in air burn in oxygen

## NFPA 704 (fire diamond)

- **Health (blue): 3** - short exposure could cause serious temporary or moderate residual injury.
- **Flammability (red): 0** - will not burn under typical fire conditions, will not burn in air unless exposed to a temperature of 820 °C for more than 5 minutes.
- **Instability–reactivity (yellow): 0** - normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions, and is not reactive with water.
- **Special notice (white):**
	- **OX** - oxidiser
