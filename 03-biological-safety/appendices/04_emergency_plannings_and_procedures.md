# Emergency planning: Procedures in case of incidents in the laboratory

## General rules on procedures for incidents

As a basic rule, the notices in laboratories and other premises regarding escape routes, fire-fighting equipment and manual alarm buttons must be followed.

## Minor incidents and emergencies

Minor incidents are, in general, to be dealt with by the person(s) who caused them, if appropriate with the assistance of the Biosafety Officers (BSO).

In the event of a serious incident, the emergency services (internal / external) must be alerted. In emergency, the response should always follow the same pattern and proceed in a linear way:

| Step         | Action for minor incident                                                     | Action in emergency                                            |
|------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Keep~calm | Get an overall view of the situation                                          | Leave the danger zone in case of aerosol formation, fire, etc. |
| 2. Alarm     | Inform BSO                                                                    | Alert the emergency services (internal / external)             |
| 3. Secure    | Confine the contaminated area                                                 | Rescue (self-protection)                                       |
| 4. Act       | Disinfect or decontaminate according to the [hygiene plan](12_hygene_plan.md) | Extinguish etc.(self-protection)                               |

## Emergency telephone numbers

Emergency telephone numbers for external emergency services and in-house persons responsible for safety are available on stickers in the laboratories next to the telephones and by the first-aid boxes.

These phone numbers are also listed in [Appendix 3](03_emergency_telephone_numbers_and_contacts_for_safety.md).
