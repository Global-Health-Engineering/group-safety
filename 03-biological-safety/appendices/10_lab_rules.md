# Laboratory rules

## Emergency
- The ETH Emergency number is **+41 44 342 11 88** from mobile devices, save this number in your contacts. If you call from the ETH stationary phone, dial **888**. All emergencies and accidents must be reported as soon as possible.
- The nearest First Aid Rooms are located in CLA E 2, ML F 32.2.
- If you have contaminated yourself with a toxic substance, you should immediately follow the instructions on the Safety Data Sheet, which you should have memorised beforehand. In the second step, alert ETH Emergency. Later, inform Jakub Tkaczuk (GSR).
- If you have dropped a bottle of mineral acid on the floor, you need to secure the spill area and collect the spill with absorbing material from the emergency closet. Alert 888 in the second step.
- Principle to be followed in an emergency situation: look - think - act.

## General
- No foods and drinks are permitted.
- Use proper storage containers.
- Find locations of the laboratory safety showers, eyewash stations, and fire extinguishers.

## Entry
- Every lab user needs to complete the "Safety in the laboratory" test before entering the lab for the first time. The screenshot of the results needs to be sent to [Jakub Tkaczuk](mailto:jtkaczuk@ethz.ch).
- Bachelor's and Master's students are not allowed to work alone in the lab.
- Children are not permitted in the laboratory.

## Clothing and safety gear
- Hair needs to be tied up, never work with long loose hair.
- Do not wear jewelry in the laboratory.
- Wear long trousers and fully covered shoes; sandals and flip-flops are not allowed.
- When one person uses chemicals, heat, or glass equipment, all persons in the lab must wear safety coats and safety googles.
- If your experiment requires gloves, make sure to select the proper ones based on the information provided for each chemical.
- Contact lenses are forbidden while working with chemical substances in the lab (the natural reflex to clamp the eyelids shut makes it hard, if not impossible, to remove the contamination in the event of an eye injury from splattering). Contact lenses are forbidden even with combination with safety glasses.
- Do not wear synthetic clothing while working with flammable liquids or gases or when a hazard is present as these materials tend to melt and stick to exposed skin.
- Never leave the laboratory wearing gloves, safety glasses, and the coat.

## Experiments
- If there is any part of an experiment you do not understand, you should pause and ask the assistant/responsible person before continuing.
- Assume that all chemicals of unknown toxicity are highly toxic.
- Combine reagents in their appropriate order, such as adding acid to water.
- Avoid adding solids to hot liquids.
- Never leave containers of chemicals open.
- Put the chemicals back in their respective safety cabinets after finishing the experiments.
- Do not use the fume hood for evaporation and disposal of volatile solvents.
- No headphones or ear buds are allowed during experimental operations.

## Cleaning
- ETH cleaning personnel is only responsible for cleaning the floor and empty the trash bins.
- Every user is responsible for proper waste disposal - do not pour chemicals down drains, do not dispose active biological waste in the general waste bin.
- Wash exposed areas of the skin prior to leaving the laboratory.
- Clean the workplace before leaving the laboratory.
