# Hygiene plan

## Scope of application

This hygiene plan applies to the BSL2 wet laboratory located in CLA J26. The laboratory manager is Dr Jakub Tkaczuk.

The biological organisms used for the research purposes in the lab are listed below:  
- Coliforms
- Fungi

## Disclosure / Circulation of information.

The hygiene plan is posted in the laboratory. Compliance to the plan is documented.

## Significance

Compliance with the hygiene plan fosters personal safety and health at work in addition to the quality of research. Cleaning agents and disinfectants are selected to fulfill their functions described in this hygiene plan, i.e., the required effectiveness and user-friendliness is warranted. Occupational safety, health and environmental protection are the criteria for selecting the products.

## General rules

- When handling disinfectants, always wear suitable gloves. Take into account potential allergies triggered by the gloves.
- Use only cold water to prepare the disinfectant solution to avoid vapors that can irritate the respiratory system. If necessary, prepare under the laboratory fume hood. 
- Use the recommended dilution and concentration.
- Let the disinfectant soak and work for the prescribed time.
- Consider the useful life of disinfectants, according to the data provided by the manufacturer. If preparing disinfectant with cleanser, renew every new day.
- Surface disinfectant is usually wiped, not sprayed.
- After wiping with disinfectant, the surfaces can be used as soon as disinfectant dries.
- Use only the disinfectants within their shelf life. The shelf life of an unused dosed surface disinfectant solution, e.g., 0.5%, in a closed storage container, e.g., spray bottle, is usually between 14 and 28 days. Check for accurate data in information provided by the manufacturer.
