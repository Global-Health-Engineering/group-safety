# Report sheet for laboratory incidents

A template of the report sheet for incidents is available for [download](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBUZSVqYkssfwdyOqsLk8zhMobOHM5KXDR3Ka4Nytfo/edit?usp=sharing). It has to be filled and shared with the responsible persons after every lab incident.

All the reports are stored by the BSO and GSR in digital form in an ordered manner.
