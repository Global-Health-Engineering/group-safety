## <a name="validity"></a>1. Validity

This safety concept was adopted by Global Health Engineering (GHE) at ETH, D-MAVT. It forms a binding framework for implementation of the statutory requirements for activities involving pathogenic or Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) in contained systems (Levels 1 and 2)[^1]. This safety concept incorporates the measures adopted by Global Health Engineering for occupational safety and for the safety of people, animals, and the environment. 

The safety concept is based on the [Safety concept according to ESV and SAMV for Level 2 laboratories](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/dam/bafu/en/dokumente/biotechnologie/uv-umwelt-vollzug/sicherheitskonzept-esv-samv-laboratorien-stufe-2.docx.download.docx/A00_UV-0817-E-ESV2019_Labor.docx) and the corresponding guidelines of the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN): [Operational safety concepts according to Containment Ordinance (ContainO)](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/dam/bafu/en/dokumente/biotechnologie/uv-umwelt-vollzug/betriebliches_sicherheitskonzeptnachdereinschliessungsverordnung.pdf.download.pdf/operational_safetyconceptsaccordingtocontainmentordinancecontain.pdf). Various templates for operating instructions and rules of conduct have been adapted to the particular lab and are listed in the Annexes together with the already existing company documents containing performance standards for environmental and occupational safety and for quality assurance.

This safety concept, as well as the general [Biosafety Concept of ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/associates/services/Service/sicherheit-gesundheit-umwelt/files/biosicherheit_neu/en/Biosafety_concept.pdf), is updated whenever the risk changes, especially when:
- new working methods are adopted;
- new organisms are handled;
- new equipment, relevant to biological safety is introduced;
- existing premises are converted for other purposes or new rooms are used;
- the activities, processes, or the use of rooms have been discontinued (see Chapter 5.1).

## <a name="objectives"></a>2. Safety objectives

Work in the laboratory of Global Health Engineering involves the use of hazardous chemical and biological substances. In the course of this work, it is never possible to entirely rule out a potential risk to people, animals and the environment. GHE takes the necessary safety measures to protect people, animals and the environment from negative effects. As an employer, the professor of GHE acknowledges its responsibility for occupational safety and the protection of its employees‘ health and takes the necessary measures accordingly[^2].

## <a name="organization"></a>3. Safety organization

### <a name="organization_i"></a>3.i Responsibility and liability

The head of GHE assumes the operative responsibility for ensuring the safety of people, the environment, as well as safety at the workplace[^3]. They ensure that the safety concept is implemented and followed and have established the organizational structure necessary for this purpose. At least one person has been entrusted with the task of monitoring the biological safety and the precise details concerning status, duties and responsibilities have been set out in the job description. These job descriptions also specify the duties, tasks, and competences in normal situations and in emergency of the laboratory managers and the project leaders. The job descriptions are an integral part of this specific biosafety concept. The necessary financial and personal resources for the purpose of maintaining biological and chemical safety are made available by GHE.

As a matter of principle, ETH Zurich as an institution (not an individual ETH employee) shall be held liable to third parties, both companies and persons. However, ETH may take recourse against employees who fail to comply with safety provisions deliberately or through gross negligence, thereby inflicting harm on a third party for which the ETH is liable. This covers the liability issue. The criminal law aspect must also be considered. Therefore, the following applies to all persons bearing responsibility for safety at ETH: *The responsibility of persons under criminal law is derived from their sphere of responsibility in relation to observing safety rules. Only those persons who, by virtue of their position, are able to prevent hazards through their own intervention can be held accountable under criminal law. This is the case if they have failed to intervene where intervention would have been appropriate and possible for them.*

### <a name="organization_ii"></a>3.ii Organizational chart

The organizational structure of GHE is described in [section 3.ii of the GHE's Operational Safety Concept](../group_safety_concept/README.md).

### <a name="organization_iii"></a>3.iii Duties of the Biosafety Officer (BSO), the Laboratory Leader, and the Project Leaders

The status, duties and responsibilities of the Biosafety Officer and the Project Leaders (PL) are set out in the job description of the respective employees. GHE conforms to the respective guideline of the Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape (SAEFL)[^4].

The duties of the BSO and PL are described in detail in:
- Annex 1. Duties of Biosafety Officer(s) (BSO) and Project Leader(s) (PL)

### <a name="organization_iv"></a>3.iv List of employees




[^1]: A laboratory where work is done with pathogenic or Genetically Modified Organisms falls within the scope of the Containment Ordinance from August 25, 1999 on the Contained Use of Organisms (Einschliessungsverordnung, **ESV**, SR 814.912) and the Ordinance on the protection of personnel from hazards due to microorganisms from August 25, 1999 (**SAMV**, SR 832.321). The scopes of these ordinances complement each other and contribute to protection of the environment, population, and the health of individual employees.
[^2]: The University defines its protection goals to prevent accidents at work as well as harmful and undesirable effects on the environment and the population.
[^3]: According to Article 7 Paragraph 4 of Ordinance 3 dated 18 August 1993 to the Employment Act (Health Protection, ArGV 3, SR 822.113) the following applies: „The rules regarding responsibilities in the plant/laboratory do not exempt the employer from his responsibility to protect health”.
