Duties:
- The BSO regularly gets further training.
- The BSO creates a lab safety concept for biological safety according to ESV guidelines and updates the concept periodically.

The BSO ensures:
- that the laboratory managers or project leaders adhere to the principles of good microbiological practice and the safety regulations.
- the safe use of equipment and methods.
- the access rules for an organization in which only authorized persons are permitted access to the Level 2 area.
- observance of correct room designation (access authorizations, biohazard signs for Level 2 areas, etc.) in relation to work with microbiological material.

- that the laboratory managers or project leaders send their reports and authorization re-quests to the Federal Office of Biotechnology Activities. The BSO provides consultative support.
- that documentation from his area of responsibility is received by the authorities, i.e., via the reporting and authorization documents. This includes the type of activities and the organ-isms, number of exposed persons, names of project leaders, names of occupational physi-cians and other specialists of occupational safety (ASA), and the required protective measures and emergency plan.
