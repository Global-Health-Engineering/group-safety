The procedure for disposal of biological waste is as follows:
1. All biologically contaminated waste is placed in autoclavable bag.
2. The bag is kept closed or placed in the biosafety cabinet.
3. Once the bag is full place it in the autoclave; make sure it is NOT tightly closed.
4. Run the standard autoclaving cycle (121 degree C, 15 min).
5. After cooldown, put the bag in a normal black bag and then in a normal waste bin.

Notes:
1. Do not overload the bag above the max load level.
2. Use only approved autocavable bags for waste decontamination in autoclave.
3. Once the waste in a bag has been autoclaved, put it in a normal black waste bag. This psychological action will make cleaning services handle the autoclaved biological waste as normal waste.
