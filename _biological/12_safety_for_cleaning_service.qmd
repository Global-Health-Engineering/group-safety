The following applies to cleaning the wet laboratory (CLA J26):
- The ETH cleaning services shall only clean the floor with conventional detergents. The cleaning staff should not touch, nor clean the desktops and the equipment.
- Waste from the general, open waste bin should be removed by the cleaning staff.
- If a "_no cleaning_" sign is displayed at the door, the ETH cleaning services should not clean the laboratory at all, neither they should take away the waste from the general waste container.
- Waste from the waste bin placed under the sink can only be handled by the ETH cleaning services if no "_biohazard_" sticker is placed at the cupboard door. In another case, when the "_biohazard_" sign is displayed, the staff should not remove, nor open the waste bin.
